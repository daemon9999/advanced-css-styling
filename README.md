# advanced-css-styling
This is just a practise for devs who enhance themselves in css styling. There is only one thing that every front-end developer should know which is 'has' in css. 
In addition, in the latest version of the css, the nested classes were added.
P.S: In some browsers, it can't work because of nested classes in css.
